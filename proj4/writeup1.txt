For this part, we implement a version of a hash function using the sandbox. 
Firstly, we copy our copy string and result string into malloced portions of the sandbox and save their length. 
Then we wrap the print function for the sandbox and use the call back function to safely untaint the string. 
From here, we can then used the wrapped get_hash function and declare it as Unsafe and unverified. 
Then, we destroy our sandbox. This method presents us from having a seg fault on the string that we pass in.
