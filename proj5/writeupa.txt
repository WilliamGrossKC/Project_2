In part a we declare two arrays for our float and uint representation. In each of the methods addrof, fakeobj, 
fakestr we create two variables first and second which we incremetn by using the method eight() in order to play
around with which parts are interpreted as tags and which as the value of a JSObject. This way we are able to 
access different parts of the memory to get our desired return.
