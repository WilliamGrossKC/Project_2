For Part B, we create the writemem and readmem methods using the fakeobj, fakestr, and addrof.
In order to do this, we create a data array and a control array in order to access memory.
We first get the address of the array using our while loop.
Then, we calculate our offerset and use memloops to transfer
our data to our data to copy array. Then we create our control array
for access. Writemem and Readmem use editmem to correctly
access the control array to read and write from memory.
