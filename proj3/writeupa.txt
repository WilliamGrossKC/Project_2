For this part of the project, we knew we had to use the floating point registers to somehow get the the print
flag function and store it as the ra of the pcb. To do this, we deciced that we were going to find the pcb
based off of the sfi return function, and then use the return address from the pcb to get to the main function,
which would let lead us to the print flag function. So, to start we load our offset and add it to the sfi return
which is in x31, then we load to the float register and convert it to integer register. THen we add our new offset
that is the address of the print flag, save that in a float register, and save it as the new ra of the pcb.
